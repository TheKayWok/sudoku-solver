# sudoku-solver
A program that will solve a sudoku for you provided it has enough inputs to solve.

This is a program that will be used to practice Python.

My current goal is to have a working program that works functionally instead of by using objects 
which seems simpler to me.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a program that will be able to look at a sudoku puzzle through a camera
and superimpose the solutions of the sudoku onto the video stream in real time.

Skills I hope to improve:
    -Python
    -Computer Vision
    -Functional Programming
